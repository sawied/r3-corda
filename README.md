# Install gitlab in Ubuntu #

There are two gitlab version available for community and enterprise, but for installation , we don't distinct both version, The enterprise package contains all the features for community version,
if you don't active enterprise features(license), so following guide will use enterprise version to install.

1. Install and configure the necessary dependencies
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install -y curl openssh-server ca-certificates
    ```
2. Add the GitLab package repository and install the package
    ```bash
    curl https://packages.gitlab.com/install/repositories/gitlab/gitlab-ee/script.deb.sh | sudo bash
    sudo  apt-get install gitlab-ee
    ``` 
3.Config Gitlab using a non-bundled web server

   1. Disable bundle Nginx(In /etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb set:)
      
      ```
      nginx['enable'] = false
      ```
   2. Set the username of the non-bundled web-server user
      
      By default,The Nginx user is *nginx* , In /etc/gitlab/gitlab.rb set:
      
      ```
      web_server['external_users'] = ['www-data']
    
      ```
   3. Add the non-bundled web-server to the list of trusted
   
      Normally, omnibus-gitlab defaults the list of trusted proxies to what was configured in the real_ip module for the bundled NGINX.
      
      For non-bundled web-servers the list needs to be configured directly, and should include the IP address of your web-server if it is not on the same machine as GitLab. Otherwise, users will be shown as being signed in from your web-serverâ€™s IP address.
      
      ```
      gitlab_rails['trusted_proxies'] = [ '192.168.1.0/24', '192.168.2.1', '2001:0db8::/32' ]
      ```
      
4.    Run sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure for the change to take effect. 
      ```
      sudo gitlab-ctl reconfigure
      ``` 
> ***Note: For Git***    
> Sometime, you want to change the gitignore, but not everyone on the team wants there changes. you can add ignore in your local global config as following:
> ```git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore``` , Add .idea to user specific gitignore file ```echo .idea > ~/.gitignore``` 


> ***Note:For Gradle***
> Using private repository to speech up downloading is useful, however, how to do this for gradle?
> put the ```gradle/init.gradle``` file into ```~/.gradle``` to change the default dependencies repository to a custom one.

# Key Components #
State objects are the data held on the ledger, which represent the current state of an instance of a contract, and are used as inputs and outputs of transactions.

The core of a smart contract is the executable code which validates changes to state objects in transactions. State objects are the data held on the ledger, which represent the current state of an instance of a contract, and are used as inputs and outputs of transactions.

1. what is the key word @Suspendable of ability ? if someone missed this annotition, what is the behavior it is?
   
   initiateFlow()
   session.send()
   session.receive()

2. if i deploy Cardapp into a production environment, it need all the platform must run in unified versions , such as JVM Corda runtime ?
  
   Application decided
   
   Spring boot, Hot-hot(Corda enterprise)

3. In development , RPC call is a main function to interact with Corda Nodes, This communicate by TCP protocol? how the network location in production environment? and how to make sure client's call is safe.
   
   RPC overs ssl
   

4. Event scheduling 's aim for issue
   
   User case: Owner change 


5. database;


# Run a Cordapp #

running the following commands from the root of the project

```
gradlew clean deployNodes
## start nodes in terminal console via:
build/nodes/runnodes.bat
```

start IOUFlow iouValue: 100, otherParty: "O=PartyC,L=Paris,C=FR"

run vaultQuery contractStateType: com.github.sawied.corda.iou.state.IOUState
